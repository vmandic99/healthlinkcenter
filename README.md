# HealthLinkCenter

HealthLinkCenter is a web application that allows patients with physical disabilities or chronic conditions to easily measure their pulse from the comfort of their home. The app uses Bluetooth technology to communicate with a smartwatch to collect data and securely stores it in a Firebase database. This allows doctors and caregivers to remotely monitor the patient's health data.

- **Firebase Integration**: All collected data is securely stored in a Firebase database.
